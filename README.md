# Minesweeper
Major Project of Fundamentals of Computer Science 2 using the language Java

This project was also during the time of this class in which I was tasked to create the infamous minesweeper game. As shown in the video, one has to select the squares without selecting one with a red mine. If there was no mine in that square, the box would be grey showing the number of mines that are bordering that particular square, giving a hint at what next square to select. The goal of this game was to essentially select the whole board without selecting the mine. As indicated in the video, once the mine was selected, the game was over.
