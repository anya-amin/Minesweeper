# Minesweeper
Project using the language Java

The goal of this project was to create the infamous Minesweeper game, in which the player chooses squares on a grid in an attempt to avoid the red mines that are hidden. When a square is safe (as in there is no mine), it becomes gray and indicates with a number how many mines are bordering that specific grid. This would give a hint to the user about what grid to select next. The objective is to select every grid from the board that is not a mine; if a mine is chosen, the game is over. This is all demonstrated in the video, with eventually at the end, a mine being chosen and the game over message pops up. During this process, several new concepts had to be implemented to program handling the neighbor mines, the flood feature, etc. This project taught me how to manage game logic and grid-based mechanics, including conditional rendering and event handling. I also gained experience in designing algorithms for calculating neighboring mines and dynamically updating the game state.
